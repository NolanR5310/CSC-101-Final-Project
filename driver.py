    #Enter a desired author, if none type na
    #Enter your price range (2 values)
    #Would you like to see fiction or non-fiction? Enter Fiction or non-fiction.


#The function will return a list of book titles along with the corresponding attributes
    #ie: author, rating(any number 0-5, based on x number of reviews), price, genre and year published
    #the list will be returned in order from best ranked to worst ranked (descending order with 5 being the best)
    #If two books have the same rating, they should be arranged in alphabetical order

#The initial data list is defined as list_of_books
#The final list which will returned the filtered list of books from the central function will be defined as final_list
#No dictionaries will be defined in this program
